This is **Taylor Swift**, the most famous famous megastar of all time, Micheal Jackstone being the 1st.

After **Braun Scooter** stole her music, she has to record it again to claim her rights. 1989 (Taylor's Version) was released on October 27 and I will rank her vault tracks that was unreleased during 2014.

The first on the list in **Is it over now**. 
The vocals are good, the instruments are magnificent, I feel like this song is too perfect for the 1989 orginal track but it kinda similar to Out of the Woods so she had to unreleased it for good. But hey, the vault has a key and it is now unlocked, enjoy this masterpiece and have fun listening to it.

This song is called "S". I ranked this in 2nd because it's so pop, the taste of this melody is Lover and the background is Reputation, oh did we mentioned the sisters akbum? THe title is Reputation while the lyrics is also Reputation, the melody is Lover and the music taste is Lover. I feel like this is a hybrid type I guess.

This song is called "Say Don't Go". I bet it's another a break up song but who cares or whatever except for the swifties who likes riddles (not me).

This song's melody is like Red because Red was released before the release of the 1989 album. "Why she had to leave this on, Why she had to twist this song, walk away and leave this in the vault in the vault."
